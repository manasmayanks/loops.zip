# Loops Practice in Java

This repository contains four Java programs that demonstrate the use of loops, randomness, and mathematical logic. Each file is designed to strengthen your understanding of iterative structures and algorithmic thinking.

## 📁 Files Included

- **GeneralizedHarmonic.java**  
  Calculates the generalized harmonic number using a loop and exponentiation.

- **BandMatrix.java**  
  Prints a band matrix pattern using nested loops and absolute difference logic.

- **RandomWalker.java**  
  Simulates a random walk for a fixed number of steps and calculates Manhattan distance.

- **RandomWalkers.java**  
  Runs multiple random walk trials and computes the average number of steps to reach a given distance.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each program accepts command-line arguments. Example:

```bash
java GeneralizedHarmonic 5 2
java BandMatrix 7 2
java RandomWalker 10
java RandomWalkers 5 1000
